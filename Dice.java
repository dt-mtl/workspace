// Assignment 4 Nancy's 3D Warrior Game
 * 
 * This class creates dice objects. Every instance of the dice is a randomly generated number from 
 * 1 to 6 . This class includes required accessor method but no setter methods as dice should never
 * be set, but rather randomly generated. additionally a toPrint method was made displaying the dice
 * roll, a roll dice method that simulates rolling new numbers and both function that checks if you rolled
 * a double, and a method that sums the resulting dice rolled should you need the value again with out 
 * having to roll the dice.
