// Assignment 4 Nancy's 3D Warrior Game
 * 
 * This class puts into play the other predefined classes Board, Dice and Player. This class will setup
 * both the players, the board game map to be used, and the dice that will be used through out the game.
 * this class follows the rules of Nancy's 3D warrior game as per assignment hand out and attempts to give do a 
 * full game play. While some functions work perfectly minor bugs hinder this class from working as desired. 
 * I hope that the work given will maximize as many partial marks as possible, in addition to giving you the
 * pleasure of enjoying Nancy's 3D warrior game.
